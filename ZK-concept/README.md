# Question
## You have the ability to quickly count the number of leaves in a tree. How can you prove this to a friend, without revealing the exact number of leaves?

To show that I can count very fast, I close my eyes and tell you whether or not to pluck a leaf from the tree. Then I open my eyes and I have to tell you if there are the same leaves on the tree or not. If I'm wrong, you already know that I don't have the superpower, but if my answer is correct, you can think that I guessed it by luck, so we can keep doing the same thing until I prove to you that I have this one. superpower.
In this case the process has to be interactive with the tester and the verifier, until I prove to the verifier that I have the superpower, as you can see I don't have to reveal the number of leaves.
